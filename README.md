# Hi, I'm Yomna üëã
**:mortar_board: Senior at Old Dominion University studying Computer Science, minoring in Data Science**

**üìñ Personal Interests: Reading, Baking, Crochet, and Scrapbooking**

Hello, welcome to my portfolio where I will showcase the projects that I have completed.

I've been interested in CS ever since I've learned how to program my first HTML website in middle school. Since then, I've decided to take a deep dive into the field and explore the different niches that this major has to offer. So far, I have been teaching myself how to use new tools and have become well-versed in several programming languages and tools, as listed below. Additionally, I've taken an interest in ML and data science ever since joining the [Break Through Tech AI](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/) 2024-2025 cohort where I have learned how to analyze the meaning behind datasets and utilized AI tools to solve common legal tasks. As my skillset continues to grow, I hope to use my knowledge to make a positive impact on society and gain more experience within the tech field. If you would like to connect with me, please feel free to reach out! Looking forward to see what is in store for the future!

## üéØ Featured Project: [Legal Case Chronology Generator for LegalDuel](https://github.com/tiffanyfu7/legalduel-1b-ai-studio)

My team and I developed an AI web application that takes in text input or a pdf upload, to generate a chronology for legal cases. 

**Tools: Python, Spacy, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, OpenAI (chat completions endpoint)**

**What we did: Used the Spacy for NLP, finetuned Open AI's pretrained models to generate text, utilized prompt engineering and Open AI's chat completions endpoint to get the model to generate the best results.**

**Results: When we finetuned the models, the best training loss we achieved was 0.2. However, the mode that we submitted to the LegalDuel platform placed 11th out of 13 bots on LegalDuel.**

**Curious? See the full project [here](https://github.com/tiffanyfu7/legalduel-1b-ai-studio)**

## üöÄ Other Projects

A few other noteworthy projects: 

1. [Analyzing NYC Vehicle Crahses](https://github.com/yomnaE1/analyzing-nyc-crashes):
   Collaborated with another teammate to analyze the causes of fatal crashes in NYC. 
   - Tech Stack: Sckit-Learn, Matplotlib, Folium, Pandas, Numpy, Python
   - Learnings: Create a visual accident map using the folium library to visualize the hotspots of fatal crahses and developed 3 ML models to see one can accurately predict the number of deaths, based on the features of the dataset.

2. [Book review Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/yomnaE1/neural-network-book-review-analysis/tree/main)
   Used a NLP and a neural network model to conduct a sentiment analysis of book reviews. 
   - Tech Stack: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, Numpy
   - Learnings: Learned how to use TfidfVectorizers and neural networks to predict sentiment (handling NLP).
